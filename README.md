ARIMA time series forecasting
ARIMA : Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average
1. AR = Autoregression. A model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations.
2. I = Integrated. The use of differencing of raw observations (eg. subtracting an observation from an observation at the previous time step) in order to make the time series stationary.
3. MA = Moving Average. A model that uses the dependancy between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
